## 1. Description of the problem

<!--
> “Do not propose solutions until the problem has been discussed as thoroughly
> as possible without suggesting any.”
>
> -- Norman R. F. Maier

Describe the problem here. You can use charts and images, but you should focus
on the problem, not the solution.
-->

Educational poverty is defined as follows [1]: 

>  "a process of limitation of children’s right to education and deprivation of their
>  opportunities to learn and develop the skills they will need to succeed in a rapidly
>  changing society"

this is a very important problem in our society and it is getting a growing attention
from cultural institutions.

Data about educational poverty is available at country level for Italy, but the data about
Sardinia is either scattered across several reports, infographics, and databases.
Sometimes, only raw data is available and some analysis is needed to derive the metrics of
interest to the people working on this issue.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Consequences of the problem

### What are the current (or predicted) consequences of the problem?

There is no report or data that can be used directly by people working on educational
poverty in Sardinia. Also, the little data that is available at country level does not help
taylor educational activities to the particular issues of Sardinia. 

### How does solving the problem fit into Sustainable Sardinia's aims?

Solving the problem requires knowledge of _computer science_ and _data science_, which
is something Sustainable Sardinia can provide.

In particular, this project fits the following points of the the Manifesto [2]: 

* A2

> "We use the techniques of data science to improve the understanding of Sardinian
> environment, economics, and society because we think successful development can only
> come from good understanding."

* A5:

> "We empower local communities in Sardinia through our work, because we think that
> development can be sustainable only if supported by local communities from within."

* A9:

> "We inform institutions, to make sure they have accurate data to take the best decisions."

* A10:

> "We inform the public to make sure they are aware of our efforts and they're aware of
> what is happening in the community and environment. To do this, we use clear, simple
> language."

and it does not go against any of the points in section B of The Manifesto.

## 3. Statement of the solution

### How does the solution work? How is it organised?
<!-- Use a block diagram, but keep it simple and clear. No UML needed here. -->

The solution is to prepare a short report that can be used effectively by those who work
on the problem of educational poverty in Sardinia. The report will be accompanied by some
infographics that can be used to communicate the work through social media.

### What resources are required to carry out the solution?

#### Human resources 
<!-- Man years for development, testing, maintenance, ... -->

The work can be carried out by a single person, working in their spare time for a couple
of months.

#### Computing resources 
<!-- Technologies, use of servers, .... -->

A laptop PC is fine to carry out the software development and data analysis work.

#### Environment resources 
<!-- Please give an estimate of the impact of your solution in terms of emissions. -->

According to available data [3], the equivalent CO₂ emissions of a laptop are between 15.4
g/hour and 30.8 g/hour. That is, to match the same emissions as that of a compact car that
drives for 10 km (about 3 kg), one would have to use the laptop for between 97 hours and
195 hours.

To minimise the environmental impact of this project, the plan is to avoid further
emissions such as those of CI/CD systems.

### How is the solution going to be tested?
<!-- Provide as many details as possible. -->

The code is not going to be tested through CI/CD. The data is going to be validated
manually/visually when it is computed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Consequences of the solution 

### What are the current (or predicted) consequences of the solution?

The solution can be of great help to those of work to address educational poverty in
Sardinia.

### How can the solution's success be measured?

If the report is used as background material for some projects in the field that
are external to Sustainable Sardinia, that would be a mark of success. Also, social media
impact could be a good way to measure the public's reaction to this work.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. Usage guide

### How is this project expected to be used/accessed?
<!-- If possible, provide some steps to guide a prospective user or tester -->

The report should be accessible online, at least from the website of Sustainable Sardinia,
and downloadable as a PDF. Further material could be made accessible through social media
channels.
